                <h3>Day 1 + 2 of Epicodus</h3>
                <p>This is where it got a little sticky. We, my partner for the day and I missed the memo that we were supposed to put our work into different repositories for each project. Therefore we have one repository for 6 different mini projects. These two days we worked on getting familiar to HTML and CSS with some basic code. </p>

              <h3>Day 3</h3>
              <p>On Day 3 of Epicodus we learned about the box model and cascading our code. These projects are meant for practice with styling and organizing our code.</p>

              <h3>Day 4</h3>
              <p>Bootstrap. Oh how confusing you can be. We continued our practice with CSS and added Bootstrap to the mix. Today was the day where we focused on one project and tried all sorts of things to make it work the way we wanted it to.</p>
