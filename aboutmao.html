   <h1>Mao Thygesen<h1>
     <p> Hello again! Thanks for wanting to read a little more about me. Let me tell you about my life in a little nutshell. I was born in Japan and raised there until the young age of 5 and a half. We got up and moved to beautiful Seattle, Washington where I went to school and eventually graduated from University of Washington. I went to school for International Studies and after graduating I got up and moved my life over to <strong>Yokosuka, Japan</strong>.</p>
     <p>I taught English at an elementary school in Japan for 3 year and aboslutely loved every minute of it. I suddenly decided to uproot my life again and move to Melbourne, Australia. I got a working holiday visa (which I suggest everyone under the age of 30 to go ahead and do) and worked while checking out all the great things Australia has to offer.</p>
